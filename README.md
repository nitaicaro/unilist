Current university rankings offer candidates lacking information about how their college experience is going to look. They overfocus on academic criteria, and underfocus on what matters quite a bit to college candidates - student experience.
The goal of this project is to provide university candidates with relevant, first-hand information about their institutions of choice.
All of the information in this project is provided by the users. Information edits and contributions can be made [in this spreadsheet.] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EqG9PymTJ_H_iJPKNYfvi5Z1cnEgtz7ajsNuVjvDx-g/edit#gid=0). 
Please feel free to add new rows (universities) as well as new columns (criteria).
