### The Goal of this Project
Current university rankings offer candidates lacking information about how their college experience is going to be. 

They overfocus on academic criteria, and underfocus on what matters most to many college candidates - student experience.

The goal of this project is to provide university candidates with relevant, first-hand information about their institutions of choice.
